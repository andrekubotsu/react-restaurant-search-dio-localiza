This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

It is using eslint for a better development.

**Packages/libs added:**
- styled-components
- styled-reset
- @material/mwc-textfield
- @material/mwc-icon
- react-slick
- slick-carousel
- react-rating-stars-component

**I though it was great to:**
- learn and apply the *react portals concept*: "Portals provide a first-class way to render children into a DOM node that exists outside the DOM hierarchy of the parent component." definition from reactjs.org 

**Observations**
- @material/react-text-field - is no longer under development (originally used in this project)
